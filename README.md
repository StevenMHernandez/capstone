# VCU Senior Capstone

Sponsor: Capital One

Goal: Provide operational insight to AWS service architecture.

## Resources

[Project Wiki](/wiki) contains information on setting things up for the project.
(For example setting up NPM, AWS, etc)
If we as a group need to explain anything to one another how to do something,
we should create a page in the wiki so that the whole group can learn.
